Twelex
======

This is my 2013 new years wishes (albeit a bit late). The running version is on http://twelex.com

What does this do?
------
Twelex takes text and transforms it into a canvas image that represents  the ITA2 or Baudot-Murray
encoding (if you could feed it to a real 1933 Telex machine it would work!)

It then sends out a tweet with the beginning of the text and and image representing the telex encoding. 
It also plays a sound. But hey 2012 was the year of the animated gif. 2013 will sure be the year of autoplaying sounds.
The main work is done in static/js/twelex.lib.js and static/js/twelex.js.

As a coding convention I started with going with ALLCAPS, but hack, wow is this hard. Brought back memories though. 
But there remains enough ALLCAPS to pleasure your eyes. Feast!

Precisely how hacky is this?
------
Very

Should this be responsive?
------
yes it should have been.

What is the License for this fine work of software craftsmanship?
------
WTFYW or later

Can I contribute?
------
WTF, Really?

Anything else?
------
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
