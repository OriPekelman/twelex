Twelex
======

This is my 2013 new years wishes (albeit a bit late). The running version is on http://twelex.com

What does this do?
------
Twelex takes text and transforms it into a canvas image that represents  the ITA2 or Baudot-Murray
encoding (if you could feed it to a real 1933 Telex machine it would work!)

It then sends out a tweet with the beginning of the text and and image representing the telex encoding. It also plays a sound. But hey 2012 was the year of the animated gif. 2013 will sure be the year of autoplaying sounds.
The main work is done in twelex.js.

Precisely how hacky is this?
------
Very

What is the License for this fine work of software craftsmanship?
------
WTFYW or later

Can I contribute?
------
WTF, Really?
